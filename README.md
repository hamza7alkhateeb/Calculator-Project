# Calculator Project

This project demonstrates two simple calculator implementations:

1. **Python Calculator (`calc.py`)**

   * A simple command-line calculator built with Python.
   * Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   * Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

   **How to run:**

   ```bash
   python calc.py
   ```

2. **JavaScript Calculators (`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`)**

   * A **Simple Calculator**: takes two inputs and performs a selected operation.
   * A **Complex Calculator**: functions like a digital calculator with buttons (AC, CE, +, -, ร, รท, etc.).
   * Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   **How to run:**

   * Open `index.html` in your browser.
